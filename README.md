## Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code. TypeScript can report issues that you may not be aware of because it can infer types. This course will teach you everything you need to know about TypeScript, starting from the basics and going all the way to advanced topics.

When writing Javascript, you should start the file eith "use strict" to avoid common mistakes. This declaration at the beggining of the file will make the code run in strict mode, which means that you can't use undeclared variables. This will help you avoid common mistakes.

## TypeScript Setup

My current setup is as follows:

```
$ node -v
v20.9.0
$ npm -v
10.1.0
$ tsc -v
Version 5.5.4
```

Set the default formatter to Prettier in VS Code by adding the following to the settings.json file:

```
    "[typescript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

Create the tsconfig.json file by running the following command:

```bash
$ tsc --init
```
